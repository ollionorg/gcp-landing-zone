We take the security of our software seriously. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please send an email to [lzadmin@ollion.com](mailto:lzadmin@ollion.com).

When reporting a vulnerability, please include as much information as possible, including:

- A description of the vulnerability

Please do not open a public GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability.

After receiving your report, the security team will assess the impact and likelihood of the vulnerability and then determine the severity level using the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document).
